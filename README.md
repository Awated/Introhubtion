# Introhubtion
Introducing myself first release. Aubergine related of course. 

Hi world, 
Born and raise as a black Pearl, I've always enjoyed shiny, wet, wildy landscape. 
My mum is an authentic riado, while adopted and took care of by an ancient family of China's giant full of seeds , which convey the pride on their family. 
If I should die tomorrow, eaten by a random yesterday-borned vegan, would you even question why and which spices came with me?
